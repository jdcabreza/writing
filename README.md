# ‚úçÔ∏è Writing

This is a collection of essays and notes about things I've come across and learned over my career as a machine learning engineer. It covers anything from technical dives into ML systems to growth as an engineer.

This is meant for me as a way to process what I learn and just to think more clearly in general. None of this is meant to be perfect, and a lot of this will just be me rambling on and on.
